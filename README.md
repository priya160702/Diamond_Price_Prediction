The relationship between dimensions (x, y, z) and price was analyzed. Categorical variables were label-encoded to make them suitable for modeling. Outliers were identified, and data preprocessing was performed. Pipelines combining a standard scaler and various regression models were constructed to determine the best-performing model. The optimal model was then tested on the test set and evaluated using metrics like R² score, adjusted R² score, MAE, MSE, and RMSE.
